# The consumer-side gate — a program built from outside the library.
#
# Type-checks the trait surface, `run[T]` instantiation, and the
# Context/Input/Canvas signatures, none of which `mojo precompile` sees. The
# pre-commit hook builds this file; the suite also runs it, which the windowed
# version could not do. Keep it minimal: it runs on every commit, and its cost
# must not grow with the example count.
