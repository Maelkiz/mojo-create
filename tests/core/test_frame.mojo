# `Canvas` takes its geometry from the `Viewport` and its extent from the
# `Surface`. The windowed loop relies on exactly that: the viewport is measured
# before events, but `Window._resize` reallocates the pixel buffer during them,
# so the two can disagree for a frame. Only the surface knows how big the
# memory actually is — hence the extent must never be read off the viewport.
