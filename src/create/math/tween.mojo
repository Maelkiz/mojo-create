struct Tween(Copyable, ImplicitlyCopyable, Movable):
    """A value moving from one number to another over a fixed duration.

    A tween is a playhead, in the same sense as `SpriteAnimator`: the program
    owns one per thing being animated and ticks it once per frame with the
    frame delta.

    ```mojo
    def create(out self):
        self.fade = Tween(0.0, 1.0, 0.4, Easing.OUT_CUBIC)

    def update(mut self, mut ctx: Context, input: Input) raises:
        self.fade.update(ctx.time.delta)
        if input.key_pressed(Key.SPACE):
            self.fade.play()

    def render(self, mut canvas: Canvas, ctx: Context) raises:
        canvas.fill(Color(255, 255, 255, Int(255 * self.fade.value)))
    ```

    Unlike an animation, a tween carries no shared artwork -- its whole
    definition is four numbers -- so there is no asset to hold by `ArcPointer`
    and every entity simply owns its own.

    **Tweening something that is not a number.** `Tween(duration)` runs 0 to 1,
    which is exactly what `Vector2.lerp` and `Color.lerp` take, so one scalar
    tween drives a position or a colour without a second type:

    ```mojo
    self.slide = Tween(0.3, Easing.OUT_CUBIC)      # in create
    ...
    self.pos = self.from_pos.lerp(self.to_pos, self.slide.value)
    ```

    Constructed stopped at `start` -- nothing moves until `play`, `loop` or
    `ping_pong`. The verbs mean what they mean on `SpriteAnimator`: `play`
    always restarts from the beginning, `pause` freezes where it is and
    `resume` continues from there.

    """The eased value, between `start` and `end`. Read this after `update`.
