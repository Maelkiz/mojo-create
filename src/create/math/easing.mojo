"""Easing curves for animation — the shape of a 0-to-1 fraction over time.

An easing curve reshapes a normalised fraction without changing its endpoints:
`ease(curve, 0.0)` is always 0 and `ease(curve, 1.0)` is always 1, but
everything between is bent. That is what separates a motion that starts and
stops like a physical object from one that moves at a constant rate.

The curves come in three flavours, and the prefix says which end is eased:
`IN_` starts slow and accelerates, `OUT_` starts fast and settles, `IN_OUT_`
does both. `OUT_` is the usual choice for anything responding to input, since
it moves immediately and decelerates into place.

Usable without a `Tween` — it is a plain function, so anything already holding
a fraction can bend it:

```mojo
var t = norm(self.x, 0.0, 300.0)
canvas.circle((0.0, lerp(-200.0, 200.0, ease(Easing.OUT_CUBIC, t))), 20.0)
```

`smoothstep` in [util.mojo](util.mojo) is a near relative but a different
tool: it maps a *range* onto an eased 0..1, where `ease` reshapes a fraction
that is already normalised.
