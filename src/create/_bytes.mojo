"""Little-endian integer decoding, shared by the file and FFI readers.

A leaf module: it imports nothing and nothing re-exports it. Both the image
decoders in `sprite` and the freetype struct readers in `render` need to
assemble bytes into an `Int`, and neither may depend on the other, so the one
copy of that loop lives here.

Deliberately absent from every `__init__.mojo` — this is internal, not part of
the public surface.
