    inverse matrix's two affine coefficients (`minv[0,0]` or `minv[1,0]`),
    constant for the whole shape (not just one row), so the caller passes
    its reciprocal `inv_step` precomputed once rather than paying a
    division on every row — `step` itself is still needed for the exact
    `== 0.0` test, since multiplying by an `inv_step` of `inf` would not
    reproduce it. `v0` is the local coordinate at column `col0` — a fixed
    reference column, independent of the `[col_lo, col_hi)` clip range,

    `step` is treated as zero below a small threshold, not just at exactly
    `0.0`: a composed matrix that is mathematically axis-aligned (e.g. a
    rotate/counter-rotate pair meant to cancel) still leaves a residual on
    the order of 1e-16 in `minv[0,0]`/`minv[1,0]` after floating-point matrix
    multiplication, which `uniform()` rejects. Dividing by that residual
    turns it into an inv_step of ~1e15, which amplifies the last bit of
    rounding noise in `step` into a huge, unstable `t0`/`t1` — different
    enough frame to frame under a continuously varying transform to make the
    solved span flicker between "whole row" and "nothing". A real rotation
    or shear is many orders of magnitude above this threshold, so treating

    into `dx^2 + dy^2 <= radius^2` turns it into this quadratic in `t`; `a`
    is `step_x^2 + step_y^2`, always positive for a non-degenerate
    transform and constant for the whole shape, so the caller passes
    `inv_2a = 1/(2a)` precomputed once instead of dividing by it on every

    solving the linear fallback would hit the identical blow-up — instead,
    since `c` is the implicit function's value already evaluated at the row's
    reference column `col0`, a negligible `a` means the row barely varies
