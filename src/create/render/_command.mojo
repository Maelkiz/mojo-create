    `Canvas` appends one of these per draw call instead of rasterising, and a
    backend consumes the whole buffer at the end of the frame. That seam is
    what lets a GPU backend exist at all: a `Surface` is a pixel pointer, which
    a GPU does not have, whereas this is just data.

    **Geometry is local, never device.** It is the shape as the program asked
    for it, paired with the `transform` that maps it — *not* a pre-mapped
    device rect. A rotated rectangle is not an axis-aligned device rectangle,
    so pre-mapping would be lossy; the CPU replay needs the matrix anyway to
    inverse-map per pixel, and the GL backend wants exactly this shape because
    the transform becomes a vertex-shader uniform. The one exception is
    `CMD_LETTERBOX`, noted above.

    Everything else the replay needs is derivable from `transform`: whether it
    is an axis-aligned uniform scale, the world-units-per-pixel factor, and the
    device scan bounds of a local box.

    `geom` slots by kind:

    | kind | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | `CMD_CLEAR` | — | — | — | — | — | — |
    | `CMD_RECT` | `x` | `y` | `w` | `h` | — | — |
    | `CMD_CIRCLE` | `cx` | `cy` | `r` | — | — | — |
