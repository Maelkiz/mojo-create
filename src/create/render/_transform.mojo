"""What a transform means to a rasteriser, independent of which one.

Three questions every backend asks of a `DrawCommand`'s matrix — is it
axis-aligned, how many pixels is a world unit, how thick is a stroke — and one
answer each, so the CPU replay and the GL tessellator cannot disagree about
them. They lived in `_backend.mojo` until the GL backend needed them too;
importing them from there would have closed a cycle, since `_backend` reaches
the GL renderer and the GL renderer reaches the tessellator.

Device-space *scanning* is not here: `device_bounds` stays with the CPU replay
that scans, because nothing else has rows to walk.
