"""Writing an RGBA buffer out as a PNG file.

The encoder half of what `Sprite._load_png` already does for decoding:
libpng's *simplified* API, reached through `_DLHandle`, with the 104-byte
`png_image` control struct laid out by hand. Nothing here knows what the
pixels mean — it takes a buffer, its extent and a path, which is what keeps it
usable both by the design-resolution capture and by a raw framebuffer
screenshot whose bytes were never a `MemorySurface`.

Its own module rather than a member of `surface.mojo` because a file format is
not a framebuffer.
