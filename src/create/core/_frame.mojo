    """Advance `program` by one frame and hand its recorded state back.

    The windowed and headless loops differ in how they get a frame started —
    one pumps SDL events and reads a clock, the other counts — but from here
    on they must not differ at all, so this is the one copy of what a frame
    *is*. It lives in its own module rather than in `run.mojo` because the
    headless path must not pull in the window.

    `state` travels in and out because a `Canvas` is a per-frame view: it is
    built for this frame and dropped before the frame is presented, so anything
    longer-lived than a frame rides in `PersistentCanvasState`.

    **The caller presents.** A frame ends with the recording complete and the
    state handed back; `state.backend.present(surface, scale)` is the caller's
    call, not this one's. That keeps the frame body target-agnostic — a GPU
    backend has no `Surface` to name — and it is why `step` grows no second
    target parameter, which is the failure mode Gotcha 4 describes. The
    windowed and headless loops both present through a `Surface` they alone
    know how to build; in the windowed case that is only valid after events
    have been pumped.
