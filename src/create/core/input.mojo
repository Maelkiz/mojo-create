    The whole input surface — there are no event callbacks, because every
    window event either lands on a field here or is already reflected in
    `Context` (`ctx.width`/`height` refresh every frame, so a resize needs no
    notification of its own).

    Passed to `update` read-only rather than living on `Context`, which is the
    one thing a program never writes: `ctx` must be `mut` for `quit` and
    `autoscale`, so anything on it would inherit that mutability and the
    one-way flow would stop being checkable.

    Being a plain struct, it is also how input becomes scriptable: a test fills
    one in and calls `step` directly, driving click- or key-driven behaviour
    with no window involved.

    `mouse` is in world coordinates, so it is negative left of and below the
    origin.
