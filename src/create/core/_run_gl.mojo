"""The GPU run loop — the same frame, presented from GL instead of a buffer.

It differs from `run.mojo` in exactly three places, and each is forced:

- the window is a `GLWindow`, so there is a context for `GLRenderer` to bind
  against and no host pixel buffer at all;
- the viewport is sized from `drawable_size()` rather than `width()`/
  `height()`, because those are SDL's *logical* size and differ from the
  backing pixels under HiDPI or fractional scaling — sizing `glViewport` from
  the logical number stretches or clips the frame;
- presenting is `present_gpu` plus `swap_buffers` rather than `present` onto a
  `Surface`.

Everything else — the event arms, the clock, `step` — is shared code, so the
two loops cannot drift in what a frame is.
